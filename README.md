# GruntJS configuration for a TYPO3 deployment

This is a sample grunt configuration that can be used for building and deploying a TYPO3 project. It has been developed, assuming a [modernpackage](http://github.com/georgringer/modernpackage) setup.

## Installation

1. Make sure node and the *grunt-cli* package is installed by running `npm install -g grunt-cli`
2. Copy all the files in this repository (except for this README of course) into the *typo3conf/ext* folder
3. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
4. (Optional but recommended) Add the folder *node_modules* and the file *npm-debug.log* to your .gitignore

## Usage

There are two main tasks

* default
* deploy

to get an overview of what each task does, just run

    grunt --help

### Building (default)

The first task, the default task, is an alias for several *sub*-tasks, which do the following actions

1. Clean up by removing previous builds
2. Minify and concatenate Javascript files using [UglifyJS](http://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)
3. Build and compress a CSS file from a [less](http://lesscss.org) source using [recess](https://github.com/twitter/recess)
4. Generate pre-compressed versions of the result of the two aforementioned tasks
5. Update a typoscript file to use the newly generated assets. A sample of how this Typoscript may look like is available in the *setup.ts* file.

Versioning is done by defining an environment variable called *BUILDNUMBER*, usefull if using this together with a CI tool like jenkins. If it is not available the current timestamp is used.

All settings that may need to be adjusted, as set as properties in the *props.yml* file. You can set globally valid settings their and may override them in a *props.SOMEVALUE.yml* if you have an environment variable called *ENVIRONMENT*.

Example:

    env ENVIRONMENT=dev BUILDNUMBER=4 grunt

Results in

    Running "clean:build" (clean) task
    Cleaning theme_mytheme/Resources/Public/Production...OK
    
    Running "uglify:build" (uglify) task
    File "theme_mytheme/Resources/Public/Production/scripts.4.js" created.
    
    Running "recess:build" (recess) task
    File "theme_mytheme/Resources/Public/Production/styles.4.css" created.
    Uncompressed size: 60040 bytes.
    Compressed size: 7025 bytes gzipped (47815 bytes minified).
    
    Running "compress:build" (compress) task
    Created theme_mytheme/Resources/Public/Production/styles.4.css.gz (8937 bytes)
    Created theme_mytheme/Resources/Public/Production/scripts.4.js.gz (39654 bytes)
    
    Running "tsconfig" task
    
    Done, without errors.

### Deploying

The second task is `grunt deploy`

It runs all the tasks of the default tasks and deploys the result onto a remote host using ssh. This is what happens:

1. Create a tgz file with the contents of the *typo3conf/ext* folder. ".git" paths and documentations are always excluded. Additional excludes (in the example development extensions like phpunit or extension builder) can be listed in the props.yml
2. Copy the tar into the /tmp/ folder of a remote host
3. Unpack that tgz
4. Backup the existing ext folder and move fresh one into it's place
5. Remove the caching folder *typo3temp/Cache/Code/core_cache* of the target installation. Otherwise a fatal error will be generated if an extension was heavily refactored or even removed. 
6. Run the [coreapi](https://github.com/etobi/ext-coreapi) task "dbcompare" to have the latest DB schema in place
7. Run the [coreapi](https://github.com/etobi/ext-coreapi) task *clearallcachesexceptpagecache*
8. Go back to the local installation and reset the typoscript changed in step 5 of the default task. This way git won't complain about changed files if you deploy from your local machine

## TODO

* Add PHP specific tasks like running phpunit and behat tests or a code sniffer
